## **Introduction**

The **"Manage Issue Ticket Archives"** plugin helps you clean up old resolved tickets in Jira by archiving them based on their age like tickets closed 90 days ago, 6 months ago, or on a specific date.

Instead of doing this manually, the plugin makes the process quick and automatic. It works with **Jira Premium or Enterprise plans** and is great for keeping your project tidy and organized.

This guide will show you how to set it up in **Agent Studio** in just a few steps. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Jira** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Jira Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=jira&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Ensure the following permissions are granted:**

- **Admin Access**: Required to archive issues using the Jira API
- **Project Access**: Ability to view and manage issues in the target Jira projects
- **Field Access**: Permission to read and update the **Priority**, **Assignee**, and **Resolution Date** fields

**Note:**

- This plugin requires a **Jira Premium or Enterprise plan**, as the issue archive feature is only available in these plans.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
