## Installation Steps
 
We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.
 
**For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions:**
 
- Read access to the `alm_entitlement` table
- Read access to the `sys_user` table (for resolving user display values)
 
Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
