# **Introduction :**

The **“Lookup My Jira Tasks”** plugin enables employees and support teams to easily track their Jira tasks specifically overdue and upcoming tasks using the Moveworks AI Assistant. This plugin allows users to retrieve their task list directly from the Assistant, without needing to navigate through Jira’s interface.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in Agent Studio, so your team can stay on top of their responsibilities, improve task visibility, and ensure nothing slips through the cracks.

Let’s get started!
